# prediction-of-cancer-recurrence
Application of various machine learning techniques on a breast cancer data where cancer is most likely to recur. 
The data set focuses on specification of tumors and the type of the tumor.
Data pre-processing and feature selection was done.
Applied machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, the boosting techniques such as AdaBoosting and Extreme boosting. 
Achieved an accuracy of 99.37 % with Extreme boosting with sensitivity of 0.9737
